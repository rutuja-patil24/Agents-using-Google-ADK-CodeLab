# MCP & A2A Protocol Practice – ADK Codelabs

This repository contains my implementation of three Google **ADK (Agent Development Kit)** codelabs to practice **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** and **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** protocols. Each task is organized into its own folder with code and documentation.

## 🧩 Task Details

### ✅ Task 1 – Multi-Agent System with A2A
📁 Folder: [`task-1-multi-agent-a2a`](./task-1-multi-agent-a2a)  
This task implements a **multi-agent system** using ADK and demonstrates how **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol** enables secure message passing and collaboration between agents. It includes Agent Engine deployment and agent configuration examples.

---

### ✅ Task 2 – Currency Agent using MCP + A2A
📁 Folder: [`task-2-currency-agent-mcp`](./task-2-currency-agent-mcp)  
This task introduces **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. The agent performs **currency conversion** using external tools exposed via MCP, demonstrating dynamic tool calling and structured data exchange in a multi-agent setup.

---

### ✅ Task 3 – A2A Action Engine (Purchasing Concierge)
📁 Folder: [`task-3-a2a-action-engine`](./task-3-a2a-action-engine)  
This task showcases **Action Engine**, an advanced form of A2A interaction, where agents collaborate to complete complex multi-step user requests (like searching and comparing products) using agent task delegation.
