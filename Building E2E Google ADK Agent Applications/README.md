# Building E2E Google ADK Agent Applications Using Codelabs

This repository contains my implementation of **five end-to-end AI agents** using **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)**. Each agent is built based on official Google blogs or codelabs and demonstrates real-world use of **AI agents, MCP tools, Gemini CLI integration, and ADK pipeline orchestration**.  
Each task is organized into its own folder with setup instructions, code, and demo.
